## Arrays
*An Array is a collection of elements stored in Contiguous memory location. All elements of array are of same data type (int, float etc.)
Array allow for eficient access and manipulationn of data.*

-> Arrays are of fixed size
-> Arrays are homogeneous in nature (A single data type of elements are used)

*In Python we use list instead of array as they provide more flexibility. However, python provide ability to use array via libraries such as numpy and array*
